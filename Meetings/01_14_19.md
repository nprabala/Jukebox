## Thoughts on Song Features

* Spotify API vs Generating our own dataset


## Generating Spotify Features 

* Grab Top Ten Songs and Collect song features 
* Take average of features
* Generate Random Radio Seed From Features


## Our Contributions

* Curate Interests from nearby users
* Generate Random Group Playlist
* Regularly Maintain and Prune Group Preferences 
* Store And Share Seeds For Later Use



# Big Picture (Personal) Goals
* Help People
* Mental Health
* Learn Something New
* Help AI to reduce bias
* Medical Scheduler
* Patient Data
* Text To Voice 

## Alternative Ideas

### Mobile/Web
* Jukebox
* Social Calendar (Share Group availability, see who's free, etc)
* tinder_eats (Recommends restaurants)
* App sticky notes (GUI for a sticky pad notebook) 
* IDEa (A note app that automatically interfaces with whatever cloud service you use to store your notes)
* Office Hour Queue Improvement (Tool to manage queue at Office Hours - Group by Question) 
* Ghost Stories (See Pictures of things that happened in a place)
* Travelgram (Instagram but designed for travel and annotate pictures really easily or pin to a restaurant, see who else has been there)
* Track Cute Dogs 
* Funny Startup Idea Generator 
* Legit Startup Idea generator (talent recruitment) 
* Source Generator (Finds you links to support your argument) 
* "Exquisite Corpse" mobile game, write a story across the world. 
* App for reporting waste or infrastructural breakdowns.

### AI/ML

* Crowdsource AI (Create a platform for people to tag and classify images -- of many types!)
* Text To Voice for your own voice



## Narrowing Down

* Jukebox (See Repo) 
* Calendar (Track everyone's free time and match you to events, friends, etc - Integrate with Calendar) 
* Travelgram (Instagram but designed for travel and annotate pictures really easily or pin to a restaurant, see who else has been there)
* Text2Voice (Think of Good Use Case) 
* Exquisite Corpse (Write a story across the world - create sentences, paragaphs, pages, with random strangers, choose to communicate after if you like. Like a more wholesome Omegle)
* Screencast Sticky Notes (Cast sticky notes, picture notes, etc to a smart TV or your own webpage - do screensharing to share with groups) 


By end of week, firmly decide on an avenue to pursue.
